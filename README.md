  My programming journey started 2 years ago (August 2018)
  when I made my first "Hello, World" using Python.
</p>

<p>
  3 months later I joined the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of ParÃ¡
  where I am currently taking a course in Analysis and Systems Development.

<p>
  Lately, I'm focusing on learning JavaScript technologies like
  React && React Native && Node.js since my goal is to be a
  full stack developer.

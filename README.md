My programming journey started 2 years ago (August 2018)
when I made my first "Hello, World" using Python.
3 months later I joined the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of ParÃ¡
where I am currently taking a course in Systems Analysis and Development.

Lately, I'm focusing on learning JavaScript technologies like
React && React Native && Node.js, because my goal is to be a
full stack developer.
